Ravenous is a Yelp-like web application built with React that allows users to find restaurants in different locations with filters (best match, rating, most reviewed). 

This project is part of the Codecademy Front-end Pro Intensive Program. Ravenous uses Yelp APIs to access the data of the restaurants.

NOTES:
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
